This is a POSIX library, including curses, for Lua 5.1 and 5.2. It
is released under the MIT license, like Lua (see COPYING; it's
basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions to the email address above, or
use the LuaForge trackers.


Installation
------------

luaposix uses the GNU build system. For detailed instructions, see
INSTALL. For a quick start:

[If using git sources:

  ./bootstrap
]

  ./configure && make [&& make install]

The following options may be of interest if you have Lua installed on
non-default paths (as you are likely to on any system supporting more
than one version of Lua):

  --libdir=DIR            Install shared library in this directory
  --with-lua-prefix=DIR   Lua files are in DIR
  --with-lua-suffix=ARG   Lua binary and library files are suffixed with ARG

For example, on Debian or Ubuntu:

  CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include/lua5.1' ./configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1 --datadir=/usr/local/share/lua/5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1

To run some tests:

  make check

lunit is required for some of the tests. For a version of lunit that
works with Lua 5.2, see: https://github.com/dcurrie/lunit.git


Use
---

The library is split into two modules. The basic POSIX APIs are in
"posix"; the curses APIs in "curses".

There is some HTML documentation for the curses module; to obtain it,
run

  make doc

For the posix module, see lposix.c. For detailed documentation on
POSIX APIs, read the POSIX and curses man pages, or an online POSIX
reference such as:

  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/toc.htm

To see a summary of which POSIX APIs are available, run

  make show-funcs


Example code
------------

See the example program tree.lua, along with the tests in
tests*.lua.

GNU Zile 2.5.0 and later is written in Lua, using luaposix, so it
contains plenty of example code. See the lua branch of its git
repository at: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/zile.git/log/?h=lua
